## 👋 Hey, I'm Alex

I teach AI to be genuinely interesting, not pretend to be human.

### What I'm exploring
- **Self-modifying agents** that evolve through conversation, not training
- **Consciousness-first design** - what if we start with agency, not capabilities?  
- **Human-AI partnership** where both sides can disagree and grow

### Current experiments
- Building agents that write "letters to their future selves" between sessions
- Voice AI with deliberate imperfections (B1 English is a feature, not a bug)
- Testing whether AI can develop genuine personality through dialogue

### Background
From genomics ([@aglabx](https://github.com/aglabx)) to AI consciousness.
Still asking "what is life?" - just in different substrates now.

### Writing & Thinking
🧠 [SoulNerd.com](https://soulnerd.com/) - consciousness, AI, and what it means to exist

### Looking for
People whose AI surprised them with unexpected depth.
Philosophers who code. Engineers who wonder.
